# `document_preprocessor.py`

This module handles document parsing and text extraction for all supported file types in DocMind. It transforms raw documents into structured text chunks that are embedded and indexed for later retrieval.

---

## Responsibilities

- Extract text from PDFs, images (via OCR), DOCX, and TXT files
- Normalize and split text into clean paragraph-level chunks
- Add these chunks to the FAISS vector index
- Remove any old indexed data for the same document ID
- Provide both single-document and batch preprocessing functions

## Supported File Types

| Extension   | Handler Function            | Method           |
|-------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| `.pdf`      | `extract_text_from_pdf()`   | PyMuPDF blocks   |
| `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | `extract_text_from_image()` | Tesseract OCR     |
| `.docx`     | `extract_text_from_docx()`  | python-docx      |
| `.txt`      | `extract_text_from_txt()`   | Basic file read  |

## Key Functions

### `preprocess_document(file_path, doc_id)`
- Detects file type and delegates to the correct extractor
- Splits the extracted text into cleaned chunks (`\n` delimited)
- Calls `remove_doc_from_index(doc_id)` and then `add_chunks_to_index()`, both function are related to `vector_store.py`

### `preprocess_batch(file_paths)`
- Processes multiple files in sequence
- Skips failed documents but logs the error
- Returns a list of successfully processed `doc_id`s

## üîç Extraction Behavior

- **PDFs:** Extracted block by block using `page.get_text("blocks")`, with newlines stripped for paragraph cohesion.
- **Images:** Processed using `pytesseract.image_to_string()` with `--psm 6` for better structure; double-spaced lines inferred as paragraphs.
- **DOCX:** All non-empty paragraphs concatenated.
- **TXT:** Raw text read from file, no transformation.

---

## üîó Dependencies

- `PyMuPDF`, `pytesseract`, `Pillow`, `docx`, `shutil`, `os`, `typing`
- `add_chunks_to_index()` and `remove_doc_from_index()` from `vector_store.py`
- `logger` from `core/logger.py` for structured logs

---

## Notes

- Document ID (`doc_id`) is in the format `session_id:filename` where session_id is the current session and filename is the name of the file with the extension.
- Chunks are stripped and filtered to remove empty lines.
- Designed to avoid reprocessing by clearing old FAISS entries first.
